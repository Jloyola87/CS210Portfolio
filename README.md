Portfolio assignment for CS210
The Corner Grocer project was built to analyze text records of purchased items and track how often each appeared. This data helped optimize store layout by placing popular items in convenient spots. The program shows my ability to process files, use data structures, and deliver clear results in C++.

A map data structure was used to count items, with helper functions and error handling included. The output was kept simple, and the code followed consistent formatting and style.

Future improvements could include support for larger datasets and the addition of visualizations like histograms through external libraries. These updates would make the program more scalable and useful.

The biggest challenge was ensuring items were counted without case sensitivity. This was handled by converting strings to lowercase and trimming whitespace before storage, with help from online references.

Skills in file handling, string manipulation, and the use of maps were strengthened. These abilities transfer well to other programming tasks, and thorough documentation will remain valuable.

Maintainability was supported by breaking logic into small functions and using consistent style. Standard C++ libraries kept the program portable and adaptable.
